## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the LevelUp application repository from GitHub.

2. Open your SQL database management system and create a new database named `levelupdb`. This will be the database used by the application.

3. Import the necessary database schema and seed data. This information should be provided in the repository's documentation or setup instructions.

4. Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

5. Open the `LevelupApplication` file as a Java application. This will start the backend server of the LevelUp application.

6. To view the frontend, navigate to the `\src\main\resources\static` directory in the LevelUp application project folder.

7. Launch Live Server and open the `card` file located in the `static` directory. This will start the frontend of the application and display it in your web browser.
